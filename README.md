# Profile Settings App

This is my submission for the mobile devlopment assignment. 
The main requirment was to desing 2 screens for the user profile interface.

## What I Did
1. **Designed 2 Screens**: 
   - One screen is made using `RelativeLayout`.
   - The other screen is made using `ConstraintLayout`.
   
2. **Additional Work (Bonus)**:
   - I added the Java conection between the activities so you can navigate.
   - I included the **Arabic translation** for the interface.

## Project Structure
Here is how the files are organized in the project floder:

- `app/src/main/java/`: Contains the Java classes.
  - `MainActivity.java`: Control logical for the first screen.
  - `ProfileConstraintActivity.java`: Control logical for the second screen.
- `app/src/main/res/layout/`: Contains the XML layouts.
  - `activity_main.xml`: The RelativeLayout screen.
  - `activity_profile_constraint.xml`: The ConstraintLayout screen.
- `app/src/main/res/values/`: Contains strings, colors, and themes.

## User Interface (UI)
I tried to make the UI look mordern and clean. I picked colors that match the image and made sure the text is readable. The Arabic version also switches the layout direction (RTL).

## Screenshots

Here are the screenshots of result:
